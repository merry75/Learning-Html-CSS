<h1>The Beginning 13/12/2016</h1>
<a href="index.html"><img src="money.jpg" width=300 height=200 align="right"></a>
<p>Let's start with about who am I ?
My name is Benjamin Abitbol, i'm a 27 years old male from Paris with a master degree from an average
business school "so to speak". I recently made my alliyah in Israel a few months ago with the hope
of a new beginning and a bright future. Yet here am I today struggling to find a job in this new
country. It has now been two months I have been sending hundreds of resume to companies, passing
dozens of interviews without success until I decided no more...
No more of being dependent from the society's standards which according to their logic you should follow
those steps :
<ul>
<li>go to university/colleges</li>
<li>get a degree</li>
<li>apply and find a job</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What if you were able to chose the things you want to do in your life whenever you god damn please ?
Well it certainly didn't take me 27 years to realize that but to act upon it this is a different
story. I guess you can call this day, the Beginning of me taking actions toward my future and
not just think about endless possiblities just to remember 2,3 years later "if...if...if.." and
live with regrets.

<h2>My Plan</h2>
When it comes to making money online there are so much possibilities that you don't even know
where to start. Websites ? Advertising ? Blogging ? Affiliate ? and blabla the list goes on and
on...
The worst in all that ? If you are a complete noob/beginner such as me, you end up totally lost
and just think about what you should and should not do.
This is the process that usually everyone is confronted with:
<ol type="a">
<li>Shitload of information</li>
<li>learning</li>
<li>way too much complicated back to square 1</li>
<li>learning again</li>
<li><b><u>take action</u></b> (MOST IMPORTANT ONE where i am standing right now!)</li>
<li>keep learning while taking action</li>
<li>encounter failures</li>
<li>finally succeed and one day voila you are an Expert at what you do!</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><h2>How i will make it happen ?</h2></p>
<p>
To start and hopefully be successful in this journey I have come to the conclusion that the best way 
to do it for now is to post articles atleast each day on my website describing what I have learn and put
it to work.
Well today i learnt how html and javascript are working slightly enough to show you this. Have a
good laugh at this terrible achievement and see you tomorrow for new adventures ! :)
